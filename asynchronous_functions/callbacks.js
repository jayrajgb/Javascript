// Here, the tickets are booked but since the setTimeout is async func, 
// the answer was "undefined" because the synchronous nature of code did not wait for the response!

// One of the solutions to handle these is to use "Callbacks"
// Callbacks is nothing but passing a function as an argument to another one.
// Therefore, we can utilize inside an async func, and after completion of the async task, 
// it would call (callback) the function to carry further process.
